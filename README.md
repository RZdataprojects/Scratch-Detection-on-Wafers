# Scratch-Detection-on-Wafers
Computer Vision using a CNN

Originally done as a home exam for National Instrument, the goal of this work is to detect and neturalize chip dies which have been damaged by a scratch on a wafer.
This is done by a CNN that recognizes the scratch and enables that automatic removal of them as part of the manufacturing process.
The CNN should mostly remove dead dies, however, it should also detect "good dies", which are working dies that are at a high risk for faults as they could have been damaged by the cause of the scratch and needs to be removed as well.
